Question
You are given an array of Integers in which each subsequent value is not less than the previous value. Write a function that takes this array as an input and returns a new array with the squares of each number sorted in ascending order.

Possible clarifying questions are 
* Are all numbers positive?
* Are all the integers distinct?
* Can an empty array be given as an input? 

Here are my test cases: 
[1, 3, 9] -> [1, 9, 81]
[-4, -2, 0, 1, 3] -> [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
