Question 1: Subsets: Given an integer array of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

Time Complexity: O(2^n * n/2)
Space Complexity:O(2^n * n/2)

Question 2: Subsets 2: Given an integer array nums that may contain duplicates, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.
