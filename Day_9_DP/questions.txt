Question 1: 
In the Fibonacci sequence, each subsequent term is obtained by adding the preceding 2 terms. This is true for all the numbers except the first 2 numbers of the Fibonacci series as they do not have 2 preceding numbers. The first 2 terms in the Fibonacci series is 0 and 1. F(n) = F(n-1)+F(n-2) for n>1. Write a function that finds F(n) given n where n is an integer greater than equal to 0. For the first term n = 0.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Question 2: 
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

n>=1

Example

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: You can climb to the top in 2 ways.
A. 1 step + 1 step
B. 2 steps
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
