Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example :

Input: candidates = [3,5,2,1,3], target = 7
Output: 
[[1,3,3],[5,2]]
Time Complexity: O(2^n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Question 2: Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:

Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.

Each number is used at most once.

Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.
Input: k = 3, n = 6
Output: [[1,2,3]] 
Time Complexity: O(2^n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
