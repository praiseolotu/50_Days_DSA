Space Complexiy = O(n)
Questions: 
We build a table of n rows (1-indexed). We start by writing 0 in the 1st row. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of 0 with 01, and each occurrence of 1 with 10. For example, for n = 3, the 1st row is 0, the 2nd row is 01, and the 3rd row is 0110. Given two integer n and k, return the kth (1-indexed) symbol in the nth row of a table of n rows.

Clarifying Questions I can ask the interviewer: 
* Is it possible that n is given as 0?
* What if k is out of bound? 
Test Cases: 
n = 4 , k = 7 -> 0
n = 4 , k = 2 -> 1
n = 1 , k = 1 -> 0
