Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.

Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.

Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.

The '.' character indicates empty cells.

Constraints:

board.length == 9

board[i].length == 9

board[i][j] is a digit between 1 and 9 , inclusive or '.'.

It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.

Time and Space Complexity are both O(1), for the time  complexity their is a constant likely solution per empty cell. That is 9^nth empty space. If there are 2 empty space, that means 9^2 = 81 possible moves.
